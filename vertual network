Virtual networks:
Communication channel between resource  lanctued in the cloud
Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) allow you to create a private, isolated network in the Azure cloud. This network can be used to securely connect and manage your Azure resources, such as Virtual Machines (VMs), databases, and other services.
What is an Azure Virtual Network (VNet)?
•	Private Networking: Azure VNets provide a private IP space that is isolated from the internet and other Azure VNets, giving you complete control over your network environment.
•	Subnets: Within a VNet, you can create subnets to organize and segment your resources for better management and security.
•	Connectivity Options: VNets can connect to on-premises networks, other VNets, or the internet using VPNs, ExpressRoute, or other services.
•	Security: Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic to resources within the VNet.
Steps to Create a Virtual Network in Azure
Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to create an Azure VNet using the Azure portal:
1. Sign in to the Azure Portal
•	Go to https://portal.azure.com and sign in with your Azure account.
2. Create a New Virtual Network
•	In the Azure portal, select "Create a resource" from the left-hand menu.
•	Search for "Virtual Network" and select it from the search results.
•	Click on "Create" to start the creation process.
3. Configure Basic Settings
•	Subscription: Choose the Azure subscription you want to use.
•	Resource Group: Either create a new resource group or select an existing one. Resource groups help organize related resources.
•	Name: Give your VNet a name that reflects its purpose or the environment it supports.
•	Region: Choose the Azure region where you want to create the VNet. The region determines where the VNet and its resources will be hosted.
4. Configure IP Address Space
•	IP Address Space: Define the address space for your VNet using CIDR notation (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16). This range will be used for assigning private IP addresses to resources within the VNet.
•	Subnets: Create one or more subnets within the VNet by defining the subnet name and address range (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24). Subnets help organize and secure resources.
5. Configure Security Settings
•	DDoS Protection: Choose whether to enable DDoS protection for your VNet (optional).
•	Firewall: Decide if you want to deploy an Azure Firewall within the VNet to control and monitor traffic.
6. Review and Create
•	Tags: Optionally, add tags to categorize your VNet (e.g., environment, department).
•	Review and Create: Review all the settings you configured. If everything looks good, click "Create" to deploy the VNet.
7. Deployment
•	Azure will begin deploying your VNet. This usually takes a few seconds. Once done, you’ll get a notification that your VNet has been successfully created.
8. Connect Resources to the VNet
•	After the VNet is created, you can start connecting Azure resources like Virtual Machines (VMs), Azure SQL Database, and more to your VNet.
•	When creating a VM, for example, you can select this VNet and its subnets to define where the VM will reside.
Summary
•	Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) are private networks that provide isolation, security, and connectivity for your Azure resources.
•	Creating a VNet involves configuring the basic settings, IP address space, subnets, and security options in the Azure portal.
•	After creating a VNet, you can connect and manage various Azure resources within it.
This setup allows you to build secure, scalable, and well-organized network environments within the Azure cloud.
Here are Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) explained in 5 simple points:
1.	Private Networking: VNets create a private network in Azure, isolating your resources from the public internet.
2.	Subnets: Divide your VNet into smaller networks (subnets) to organize and secure resources like Virtual Machines.
3.	Secure Connectivity: Connect your VNet to on-premises networks or other VNets using VPNs or ExpressRoute.
4.	Traffic Control: Use tools like Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall to manage and secure network traffic.
5.	Global Reach: Deploy your VNet in any Azure region, providing flexibility and scalability for your global infrastructure needs.
