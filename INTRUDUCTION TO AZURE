  Azure:
Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. It provides a wide range of services, like storage, databases, and virtual machines, over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers, businesses can use Azure to run applications, store data, and more, all in a flexible, scalable way. It’s like renting a powerful computer in the cloud that you can access from anywhere.
Decrease the capital expenditure and operational expenditure we use cloud service
Capex=baying your own infrastructure,big intial investment
Opex= rent the infrastuture,no intial investment

Deployment models:

 
Azure offers several deployment models to accommodate different business needs and preferences. These models define how and where your cloud resources are deployed and managed. Here’s a breakdown:
1. Public Cloud
What it is:
•	Resources are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider (like Microsoft Azure) and shared with multiple organizations over the internet.
Key Points:
•	Cost-Effective: You only pay for what you use, with no need to invest in hardware.
•	Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
•	Maintenance-Free: The cloud provider manages hardware and infrastructure.
Real-Time Example:
•	A startup uses Azure’s public cloud to host its website, leveraging Azure’s global data centers without owning any physical infrastructure.
Why Use Public Cloud:
•	Ideal for businesses looking for flexibility, cost savings, and scalability without the need to manage infrastructure.
2. Private Cloud
What it is:
•	Cloud resources are used exclusively by a single organization. The infrastructure can be hosted on-site or in a data center, but it is not shared with others.
Key Points:
•	Enhanced Security: Greater control over security, compliance, and data privacy.
•	Customization: Infrastructure can be tailored to meet specific business needs.
•	Dedicated Resources: No sharing of resources with other organizations.
Real-Time Example:
•	A bank uses a private cloud to store sensitive financial data, ensuring compliance with strict regulatory requirements.
•	Why Use Best for organizations with strict security, compliance, or performance needs, like financial institutions or government agencies.
3. Hybrid Cloud
Private Cloud:
What it is:
•	A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This model offers the best of both worlds.
Key Points:
•	Flexibility: Businesses can keep sensitive data in a private cloud while using the public cloud for less sensitive operations.
•	Cost-Effective: Utilize the public cloud for high-volume tasks, reducing the load on the private cloud.
•	Seamless Integration: Allows for easy movement of workloads between public and private clouds.
Real-Time Example:
•	A retail company runs its e-commerce site on the public cloud but stores customer payment information on a private cloud for enhanced security.
Why Use Hybrid Cloud:
•	Suitable for organizations that want to balance security with cost-efficiency and scalability.
•	Ideal for businesses with fluctuating workloads or sensitive data that must remain on-premises.
Virtual machines:
Virtually creating a machines.
No physical wires involved in connecting by virtual network.
Collection of subnets is a virtual network
Security group is nothing but a fire walls.
1.	On-Demand Computing Power: Azure VMs give you flexible, cloud-based computers that you can start and stop as needed, paying only for the time you use.
2.	Choose Your Operating System: You can run either Windows or Linux on your Azure VM, just like a physical computer.
3.	Scalable Resources: Easily increase or decrease your VM's power and storage based on your business needs, ensuring you only pay for what you need.
4.	Customization and Control: You have full control over your VM, allowing you to install and run any software or application just like on a physical machine.
5.	Global Reach: Azure VMs can be deployed in data centers around the world, helping you improve performance and accessibility for users no matter where they are.
Use Cases:
1.	Development and Testing:
o	Developers can quickly spin up VMs to test new applications or features in an isolated environment, then shut them down when no longer needed.
2.	Running Applications:
o	Businesses can run applications that require specific operating systems or software configurations. For example, running a legacy business application that requires an older version of Windows.
3.	Disaster Recovery:
o	VMs can be used for backup and disaster recovery solutions, ensuring that critical applications and data are protected and can be quickly restored.
4.	Hosting Websites:
o	Azure VMs can host websites, especially when you need full control over the server environment or need to run custom server-side applications.
Real-Time Example:
•	E-Commerce Platform: An online store may use Azure VMs to host its website and database. During peak shopping seasons, the store can easily increase the number of VMs to handle more traffic, and then scale back down afterward to save costs.
Why Use Azure Virtual Machines?
•	Flexibility and Control: You have complete control over the computing environment, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and workloads.
•	Global Reach: Azure’s global data centers ensure that your VMs can be deployed close to your customers, improving performance and reliability.
•	Security: Azure provides built-in security features, like encryption and compliance certifications, to protect your data and applications.
Azure Virtual Machines offer a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solution for businesses needing computing resources without investing in physical hardware. They can be tailored to a wide range of needs, from simple testing environments to hosting large-scale, mission-critical applications.
